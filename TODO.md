What could be done next?...

* Add some code comments,
* Add some robustness around,
* Implement a commands history in debug console,
* Integrate tools access in debug console, in order to have a single entry point,
* Make I2C, SPI, etc. classes more generic, so that they could easily be reused by other projects.
